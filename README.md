# Quick Base64

Quick Base64 is an application which can convert files into Base64 format.
It can also convert base64 text to it's original format.

When decoding base64 files to it's original format, it uses the [file command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(command)) to determine the mime-type of the data.
It then decodes and write the data according to the mime-type's extension.

It is available in a GUI and a CLI. Currently, it is running on Windows only but I am hoping to compile it on Linux very soon.

#Aim:
The main aim of creating Quick Base64 was to make an encoder that could encode files to base64 format easily without any struggle.
It is also meant to be fast.
