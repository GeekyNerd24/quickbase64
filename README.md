# Quick Base64

Quick Base64 is an application which can convert files into Base64 format.
It can also convert base64 text to it's original format.

When decoding base64 files to it's original format, it uses the [file command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(command)) to determine the mime-type of the data.
It then decodes and write the data according to the mime-type's extension.

It is available in a GUI and a CLI. Currently, it is running on Windows only but I am hoping to compile it on Linux very soon.

## Aim
* Quick Base64 is meant to be fast and easy to use.
* Minimalistic interface but with great features.
